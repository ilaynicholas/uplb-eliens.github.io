Eliens is UPLB's competitive programming team. The team name "Eliens" 
was selected to honor Dr. Eliezer A. Albacea, one of the first Computer Scientists 
in the Philippines. UPLB has been participating in intercollegiate programming competitions since 2000.
Our vision is to be able to represent the Philippines in the `ICPC World Finals <https://icpc.global/>`_.
Dr. Rafael Saldana and Dr. Allan Sioson are instrumental in bringing and developing competitive programming, specifically ACM-ICPC, in the Philippines.
