In competitive programming, competitors are given a set of programming 
problems to solve within a given time period. The competitor who solved 
the most number of problems or has accumulated the highest score is 
declared as the winner. Just like in sports or games, competitors need to 
practice in order to win. The types of programming problems usually involve 
data structures and algorithms as well as math concepts.
